            <h1>Portfolio</h1>
            Here is a list of projects I've done.
            <h1>Mouseless Mouse</h1>
            I was part of the team for <a href="https://github.com/aggie-coding-club/mouseless-mouse">mouseless mouse</a> which was a project to create a mouse cursor device in the form of a glove which you could maneuver around. As part of the mouseless movement team I used linear algebra and statistics in order to calibrate the magnetic sensors so that the device is able to move smoothly depending on how it is oriented. This project was programmed in C++.
            <h1>UnityStation</h1>
            I developed code for an open source game <a href="https://www.unitystation.org/">UnityStation</a> including <a href="https://github.com/unitystation/unitystation/pull/1094">a system for rotating different maps used in the game</a> and adding <a href="https://github.com/unitystation/unitystation/pull/1368/files">DNA and bloodtypes to entities in the game</a>. For this project I used C# and the Unity Engine to develop code.
            <h1>Hexapods</h1>
            Hexapods is a project I will be working on this semester which will focus on making programming various types of movement for six legged robots. In addition, the project will involve deploying multiple robots to conduct search operations.
            <h1>Prometheus Commodities Exchange</h1>
            In C# and the <a href="https://docs.discordnet.dev/">Discord .NET</a> library I made a discord bot which would simulate the exchange of different commodities for a game. In the bot I was able to sort how to arrange the data to match buy and sell offers and make the requisite changes to external sheets when sales were made.
            <h1>National Cyber League</h1>
            I have participated in <a href="https://nationalcyberleague.org/">National Cyber League</a>, a capture the flags cybersecurity competition which tests cryptography, network analysis, and software exploitation. I used Python, Perl, software Dissasemblers, and javascript for this competition.
            <h1>The New Order: Last Days of Europe</h1>
            I was on the development team for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2438003901">The New Order: Last Days of Europe</a>. As part of the development team I designed and implemented new systems in the game. I used Paradox Scripting in my time as a developer for the project.
